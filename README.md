An application to expand vim with custom functionalities via Python.

This is a small tool I use to expand my Vim with some functions I find convenient to have when using Vim as a scripting tool.
While I personally use this little program as is this project is supposed to be an exmaple of how to expand vim with functionalities without having to use VimScript.
