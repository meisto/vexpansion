An application to expand vim with custom functionalities via Python.
This project is still WIP.

This is a small tool I use to expand my Vim with some functionalities I find convenient to have when using Vim for simple scripting.

While I personally use this little program as is this project is supposed to be an exmaple of how to implement plugins for Vim using python3.

#structure
This application starts a server which can be contacted via udp. This is done from Vim with Python3.
